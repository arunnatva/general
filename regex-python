python regex to find a pattern and replace that with another pattern using back references:

import re
regex = r"\bsampleword\((\S+) as timestamp\)"

test_str = "select col1,col2,col3,sampleword(col4 as timestamp) as col4_1, col5 from table"
substitute = "from_utc_timestamp(\\1) here \\1 is the back reference that points to the firsrt grouping found in the regular expression

replace logic

re.sub(regex, substitute, test_str, 0, re.MULTILINE | re.IGNORECASE)
if(result):
    print(result)
